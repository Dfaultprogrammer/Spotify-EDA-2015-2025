## 📊 ***_Key Visual Insights_***

The following visualizations represent the most important findings from the exploratory data analysis.  
Each chart highlights a specific trend, relationship, or pattern observed in the Spotify dataset.

---

### 📅 ***Year-wise Song Release Trend (2015–2025)***
![Year-wise Song Release Trend](images/yearwise_trend.png)

This line chart shows the number of songs released on Spotify each year.
- Song releases remain ***largely consistent*** across the years
- A noticeable dip appears around ***2021***, followed by recovery
- Overall trend suggests ***stable content production*** rather than aggressive expansion

This indicates that Spotify maintains a ***steady inflow of music content*** over time.

---

### 📈 ***Stream Count vs Popularity***
![Popularity vs Stream Count](images/popularity_vs_streams.png)

This scatter plot explores the relationship between total stream count and popularity score.
- Songs with ***higher streams generally show higher popularity***
- The relationship is ***positive but not perfectly linear***
- Several songs achieve high popularity without extremely high stream counts

This suggests that while streaming volume influences popularity, it is ***not the only determining factor***.

---

### 🔗 ***Correlation Heatmap of Audio Features***
![Correlation Heatmap](images/correlation_heatmap.png)

The correlation heatmap highlights relationships between audio features and popularity.
- Most audio features show ***weak or near-zero correlation*** with popularity
- Stream count has a ***moderate positive correlation*** with popularity
- No single audio feature strongly dominates song success

This implies that ***musical popularity is multifactorial***, influenced by more than just audio characteristics.

---

### 🎤 ***Top Artists by Average Popularity***
![Top Artists by Popularity](images/top_artists_popularity.png)

This bar chart displays the top artists based on ***average popularity***, considering artists with a minimum number of songs.
- A small group of artists consistently achieves ***higher average popularity***
- Indicates strong ***artist-level influence and brand recognition***
- Highlights how audience loyalty impacts long-term popularity

This reinforces the idea that ***artist identity plays a significant role*** in streaming success.

## 💡 ***_Key Insights Summary_***

Based on the exploratory analysis of Spotify data from 2015 to 2025, the following insights were observed:

- 🎵 Song releases remained ***relatively consistent*** over the years, with minor fluctuations.
- ⭐ Average song popularity showed ***limited variation***, indicating stable listener engagement.
- 📈 Stream count has a ***moderate positive relationship*** with popularity, but does not solely define success.
- 🎶 Individual audio features alone do ***not strongly influence*** popularity.
- 🎤 Artist-level influence plays a significant role in achieving ***consistently high popularity***.

These insights highlight that ***music popularity is driven by a combination of factors***, including streaming behavior, artist recognition, and audience engagement.
